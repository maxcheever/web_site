      computational idealism arises from digital capitalism's attempt to escape from the abiguity 
      present within human existence. formally introduced to me as an aesthetic by M. Beatrice Fazi in 
      <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781786606082/Contingent-Computation-Abstraction-Experience-and-Indeterminacy-in-Computational-Aesthetics">
         <i>Contigent Computation</i></a>
      by way of Daniel Tempkin's 
      <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/esoprogramming-and-computational-idealism#:~:text=%5BC%5Domputational%20idealism%20holds%20that,the%20axiomatic%20character%20of%20computation.">
         <i>Esoprogramming and Computational Idealism</i></a>,
      the pursuit of computational idealism is a practice that has found a place in my subconscious 
      through my education in computer science. I am taught to make things that are simple and 
      elegant, and this is just that. Each piece consists of a single nested 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loop</a> to loop over the pixels in the frame, 
      with the only difference between them being the color and pixel that is chosen at a given iteration.
      Before I could attempt to express myself as an artist, I expressed myself as someone subconsciously 
      in pursuit of the computationally ideal (and perhaps this is still the case), and I feel this work
      is representative of that.
